# Users-Policies-Restful-WebApi
Web Api to retrieve data from users and policies related

Requirements

NodeJS and MongoDB in local environment

Mongoose is used to create real instance of abstract entities of the database
model. Entities like User and Policy are created by means of Mongoose, and allow
a very straight-forward correspondance with data in MongoDB.

"Everything in Mongoose starts with a Schema. Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection and defines the shape of the documents within that collection."
